Bean Factory  - for small application.
Application Context - for enterprise level application.
getBean : is an method which we can get from 2 interfaces - either Beanfactory or Application context  , to work with either of them we have to import a package .
Application context is a superset of bin factory , any feature provided by Bin factory is also provided by application context.
to work with getBean method we need a xml file.
we will define bean tag in xml , in this tag we will define the ID, Vehicle and class also we have to define the tag using xmlns,xsi and bean id 
using spring.xml file we can use the objects defined in that xml file in our java code without changing the source code of the xml file .
